Build status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/letsencrypt/lets-encrypt-preview.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/letsencrypt/lets-encrypt-preview)

This is the Let's Encrypt Agent **DEVELOPER PREVIEW** repository.

**DO NOT RUN THIS CODE ON A PRODUCTION WEBSERVER.  IT WILL INSTALL CERTIFICATES
SIGNED BY A TEST CA, AND WILL CAUSE CERT WARNINGS FOR USERS.**

This code is intended for testing, demonstration, and integration engineering
with OSes and hosting platforms.  Currently the code works with Linux and
Apache, though we will be expanding it to other platforms.

## Running the demo code

### on Ubuntu

```
sudo apt-get install python python-setuptools python-virtualenv \
  python-dev gcc swig dialog libaugeas0 libssl-dev
virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
./venv/bin/python setup.py install
sudo ./venv/bin/letsencrypt
```

Note, that letsencrypt does not yet handle Debian unstable's Apache2
conf layout.

### on OSX

* [swig] is required for compiling [m2crypto].
* [augeas] is required for editing configuration.

```
sudo brew install swig
sudo brew install augeas
```

## Hacking

1. Bootstrap: `./venv/bin/python setup.py dev`

2. Test code base: `./venv/bin/tox`

## Command line usage

```
usage: sudo letsencrypt.py [-h] [-d DOMAIN [DOMAIN ...]] [-s SERVER] [-p PRIVKEY]
                      [-c CSR] [-b ROLLBACK] [-k] [-v] [-r] [-n] [-e] [-t]
                      [--test]

An ACME client that can update Apache configurations.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DOMAIN [DOMAIN ...], --domains DOMAIN [DOMAIN ...]
  -s SERVER, --server SERVER
                        The ACME CA server address.
  -p PRIVKEY, --privkey PRIVKEY
                        Path to the private key file for certificate
                        generation.
  -c CSR, --csr CSR     Path to the certificate signing request file
                        corresponding to the private key file. The private key
                        file argument is required if this argument is
                        specified.
  -b ROLLBACK, --rollback ROLLBACK
                        Revert configuration <ROLLBACK> number of checkpoints.
  -k, --revoke          Revoke a certificate.
  -v, --view-checkpoints
                        View checkpoints and associated configuration changes.
  -r, --redirect        Automatically redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS for
                        the newly authenticated vhost.
  -n, --no-redirect     Skip the HTTPS redirect question, allowing both HTTP
                        and HTTPS.
  -e, --agree-eula      Skip the end user license agreement screen.
  -t, --text            Use the text output instead of the curses UI.
  --test                Run in test mode.
```
